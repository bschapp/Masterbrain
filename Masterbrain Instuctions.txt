This game follows the standard Mastermind instructions. 

A sequence containing 4 colors ('pegs') is randomly generated and hidden from the
player. Colors may repeat.

The object is to guess the sequence. Enter your guess using the letter that represent each
peg (provided at the top of the window).

Your guess will be displayed. To the right of your guess will be displayed red
and white squares. 

A white square indicates that a peg you chose is in the sequence but is not in the correct 
position. One white square will be displayed for each peg meeting this condition.

A red square indicates that a peg is both in the sequence and in the correct position. 
One red square will be displayed for each peg meeting this condition.

Note that the posistion of the squares is NOT indicative of the posistion of the peg. 
All red squares are displayed first, followed by all white squares.

You have eight chances to guess the correct sequence. Good luck.
